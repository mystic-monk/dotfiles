# Dotfiles

## Usage
1. Generate new SSH keys and add them to your GitHub account
    1. Alternatively, restore your safely backed up SSH keys to `~/.ssh/`
2. Install Homebrew and git
  ```bash
  /usr/bin/ruby -e "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install)"
  brew install git
  ```
3. Clone this repository
  ```bash
  git clone git@github.com:rkalis/dotfiles.git
  ```
4. Run the `bootstrap.sh` script
    1. Alternatively, only run the `setup.sh` scripts in specific subfolders if you don't need everything
5. (Optional) Point the Alfred preference sync to a backed up folder
6. Login to applications, enter license keys, set preferences

## Customisation
I strongly encourage you to play around with the configurations, and add or remove features.
If you would like to use these dotfiles for yourself, I'd recommend changing at least the following:

#### Git
* The .gitconfig file includes my [user] config, replace these with your own user name and email

#### OSX
* At the top of the setup.sh file, my computer name is set, replace this with your own computer name

#### Packages
This folder is a collection of the programs and utilities I use frequently. These lists can easily be amended to your liking.

#### Repos
This folder is a collection of my own repos, some of which are even private. The existing lists can easily be edited or replaced by custom lists.
